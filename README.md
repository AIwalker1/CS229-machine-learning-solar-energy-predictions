# CS229 Project Files

by Adele Kuzmiakova, Gael Colas, and Alex McKeehan, graduate students at Stanford University. This repo contains all project files used for the class. Course notes are available from the course website at http://cs229.stanford.edu/ or https://see.stanford.edu/course/cs229. 

**Goal:** Predict the solar energy output from a solar power plant at the University of Illinois using weather features and local meta-data, for instance, the month or the hour of the day.

**tl;dr:** LSTM networks performed the best for the prediction of the solar output due to their abilities to connect recent features to perform present day predicitions.

This is our final project for the CSS229: "Machine Learning" class in Stanford (2017). Our teachers were Pr. Andrew Ng and Pr. Dan Boneh.

Language: Python, Matlab, R

Goal: predict the hourly power production of a photovoltaic power station from the measurements of a set of weather features.

This project could be decomposed in 3 parts:
